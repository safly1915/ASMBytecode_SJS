I feel as though I understand everything well. I think not knowing Java holds me back a little bit, but I'm pretty sure I know what the commands do. I know exactly what each line of code does,
my only struggle is knowing the small, minute commands and keywords in specific actions. I think I am still struggling with rapping my head around the GETSTATIC and INVOKEVIRTUAL, as you'll see
on my exam, but I have come to have some kind of understanding about it. The code itself makes sense to me and I know what is going on, it is just the Java keywords that I still have trouble
with simply because I don't have a background in Java.
